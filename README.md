# Ruby Style Guide

This guide is for edge cases and subjective matters that cannot be automated using tools like Rubocop

## High level guidelines

* Aim for simplicity - ["I think most programmers spend the first 5 years of their career engaging complexity, and the rest of their lives learning simplicity."](https://twitter.com/buzz/status/7203012768).
* Always remember the [Yagni](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) mantra.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
